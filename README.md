## Engineering Project
This projects contains of two approaches to neural networks, a potential gamechanger - **Quaternion Neural Network**, and a well known **Real Valued Neural Network**. Implementing these two models exhibits the differences between the performance on a task of pixel classification in 
disaster events.

# Problem

# Labels
The model contains 13 different classification classes
